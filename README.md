## 🌟 **Project Overview**  

The **Interactive Museum Blog Project** aims to create an engaging platform that not only serves as a traditional blog but also interacts with users by focusing on museums in Turkey. With a simple search, users can retrieve comprehensive information about a museum from Wikipedia. This project features real-time location tracking, sharing of experiences from previous visitors, e-ticket sales for museum visits, and the ability to sell museum-related objects and books—all without requiring user registration!
